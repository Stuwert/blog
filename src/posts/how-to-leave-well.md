Aside: The impetus for this article is my current experience switching teams in my role, but I thought it would be a good time to reflect on my other experiences with leaving, good and bad. **As of this writing I am still quite happily employed.**

There are lots of reasons you might end up leaving a team. Maybe you’re leaving a company for a better opportunity, maybe your current role isn’t working out, maybe you’re staying at the company but leaving for a new role or a new part of the company. All of these moments can be incredibly emotionally charged which makes navigating them especially challenging.

Our emotions upend our behaviors, especially around the times when we’re getting ready to leave, that can make our own incentives misaligned with the incentives of our team and management.

There are three responses during this process

- Things You Probably Care About, But Shouldn’t
- Things You Need to Come to Terms With
- Things To Finish As You Leave

## Things to Come to Terms With

### You Just Have Like… Way Less Time Than You Think You Do

Finishing projects on time is hard enough in perfect circumstances. Finishing projects while you’re also doing the thing where you’re trying to unwind your existing responsibilities. The nature of all human endeavor is that you’ll always be covering areas that aren’t exactly articulate, or your might have priorities, goals, and beliefs that you would like to see continued after you leave.

Deadlines create all sorts of huge incentives for us to complete stuff we’d been putting off for long periods of time. Leaving is not the right time to check off a bunch of stuff on your checklist. It is the right time to prioritize even more aggressively and recognize you’ve got one, maybe two things you can hand off really well, and make sure your efforts are focused there.

### Leaving Knowledge gaps

Your goal with creating a successful rolloff is not to create 15 pages of documentation. Creating extensive documentation right before you leave probably isn’t all that helpful. Mostly because it’s coming from an unhelpful “brain dump” perspective which isn’t exactly the types of UX that people find all that useful. Imagine you were going to school and your teacher was going to start teaching a different class that week and tried to cram everything they might have taught you for the quarter in that week. It would suck.

Instead, just focus on making sure the initiatives or projects you had ownership of have people who will take care of them. Do this at the start of your rolloff and make sure you’re around for teammates to pull information from, but don’t worry about the stuff that’s going to drop. It’s not your job to figure it out, and even if it was you don’t have enough time to do it well.

### Your unfinished work or ongoing commitments

It’s possible that you’ve created an agreement where your relationship to a given team is contingent on the completion of a project and a set of projects. (Maybe you’re a consultant working in an area of the division, or maybe you’ve been an embedded resource) But unless there are very specific circumstances (and I would argue even in those cases there will probably be some misses) you’re not going to finish them.

Your goal in your remaining time is absolutely not to finish them. There is no world where you finish your commitments, leave gracefully, and are recognized for the awesomeness of those commitments. So just like… stop. The more likely outcome is that you make a royal mess, undercommunicate and underdeliver and everyone else will be less happy as a result, including you who was stressed right up until the last moment.

Instead of trying to finish stuff you’re working on, I would take the perspective that, from the moment of the announcement, assume that you’re relationship to your commitments is functionally over (as a primary driver), and spend more time thinking about communication as your primary goal. What loose ends do you want to be sure have owners, what timelines are still unclear.

## Things Not to Care About

### Your professional reputation, as it relates to the projects you’ve been working on

The first time I ever left a job as a dev I was so focused on finishing this big project because I really wanted them to remember me well. I thought if I could deliver this one thing I would be remembered really well.

Flash forward months later and chatting with old coworkers they let me know that the work I thought I crushed was full of bugs, they didn’t really understand what I had accomplished and it caused a lot more problems than it was worth.

This has led me to the conclusion that the second your departure has been announced, the people on your team are already planning and thinking about life without you. In a lot of ways they’re already thinking about you in the past tense. Trying to over own and “finish stuff well” isn’t going to change their opinion of you positively and might actually end up causing them more pain than it’s worth, especially if you’re working right up to the end.

### Thinking about how your departure will impact team dynamics

Maybe I’m just super self centered, but whenever I’ve left or changed teams, I’ve always imagined how my departure might impact the team I’ve been on. I’ve wondered how they’ll fill the gap and imagine what might accidentally blow up.

The reality is, that either you’ve done a good enough job communicating and partnering with team members pre-move that they’ll be happy to continue championing your goals post-leave, or you haven’t and they won’t. So leaving isn’t the right time to try to do that communication.

Your priorities aren’t the teams priorities (even when you were there). This falls pretty closely in line with [Let It Fail](https://www.maxcountryman.com/articles/let-it-fail) where the reality is is that if you were heroically holding up some aging system, you probably weren’t doing your team or yourself any favors. Your leaving is probably not going to cause an immediate collapse but is much more likely to cause some pain that either gets resolved or carries on. It’s a much less exciting outcome (especially if you felt important), but it’s the truth.

Instead of over documenting or fretting, use the two weeks to emotionally let go of those things you’ve cared about. Talk through the situation with your coworkers and management, and support them in the situations where they ask for help, but don’t feel the need to push all of your knowledge out. The team will find a way.

## Things to Finish

### Assign owners for remaining tasks to make sure that they get picked up

Do this early and often. Just make sure there’s someone somewhere that’s aware of important work you’re doing, and offload the knowledge of its existence immediately. DO NOT worry about boring them with a checklist of every small thing in your head. The second your gone that checklist is going out the window so don’t waste their time or yours. Explain enough so they can bear the weight of the added responsibility, say you’re around and then let them handle the solution. It’s an example of [Celebrating a Successful Landing](https://www.urback.net/posts/a-deeply-incomplete-review-of-the-staff-engineer-s-path/)

### The logistics of leaving

Focus on the project management of it all. Instead of worried about the stuff that will continue on without you, focus on the very practical stuff like the timeline of your exit. When will your move be formalized? What slack channels will you remain in and what will you exit? When will that happen? Are there meetings you’re going to stay attached to? For the rest, when do you intend to stop showing up?

Are there specific meetings you want to have to formally hand-off work? Are there launches or other deadlines that will occur within your final weeks of being on that team? How do you plan to handle those?

I would recommend spending a bunch of time thinking about the dates and times that various moments have to happen, and getting good agreements with the leaders on your team as to why and when they’ll occur. That way you have a clear plan.

### Quit early

The one job I felt I had a semi-successful exit from, I was done a week early and was sitting on my hands. I felt really silly for doing this but in retrospect it was actually my most successful exit. Like I was taking up unnecessary space. But what it actually meant is that there was enough slack in the system for the team not to have the pressure of my leaving. I was around to answer any questions but wasn’t critical to having those questions answered.

## Leaving Is Hard

No matter how you spin it, doing any sort of move from a project or team you were on to another one is hard. Even if it’s within the same company, as the result of a successful outcome, and you’re excited about the future, there’s a whole host of emotions that comes along with it. Give yourself the time and space to process those emotions, as part of the leaving process and not as something to deal with after it’s all over.
