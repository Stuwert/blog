## Go Write Someone Feedback

What if I told you there was one small weekly behavior you could do to improve your career goals, increase psychological safety, make people like you more at work, and make you a slightly better person? That would be an oversimplification, but I don’t actually think it’s that far off the mark.

You should make a weekly habit of finding someone to give positive feedback to, and give it to them formally and in writing so their manager can see. I started doing this, probably close to a year ago now, as a way to give back to my coworkers. And I’ve just kept going because every time I do it, I feel a little bit better.

If you’re reading this it’s likely that you have some sort of formal feedback tracking system that you can input. And if you’re not, you can send an email.

I’m going to list three reasons, one selfish, one altruistic, and one in between. I would encourage you to pick a reason, or make one of your own, and make it a weekly habit.

### 1. The Selfish Reason

Writing lots of feedback, I believe, is an important point of visibility in your favor. As you share feedback with managers, it spreads your own influence, shows that you care about (and can speak to) company values, and puts you as someone they’re connected to in your head. It can be incredibly hard to get into “the conversation”, but sharing feedback is a reasonable, low effort way to put yourself in front of management without having to find “important projects” or “sponsors”. It also creates a better relationship for you with the person you just had an interaction with, and it makes them more likely to give you feedback in the future.

### 2. The Altruistic Reason

At every job I’ve had I’ve felt it was basically close to impossible to understand how people actually felt about the work I was doing. This isn’t to say I never received positive or negative feedback, just that it typically came in the form of big moments. A project that went well, a raise, or a project that went poorly, or some big feedback about behavior that needed to be corrected. The small stuff, the clarifying, steadying stuff often goes unnoticed. I cannot tell you the number of times where I did something nice for someone and never heard about it, but would’ve been through the moon for a small thank you.

And I cannot tell you how many times I’ve left feedback now to receive a thank you and a very clear mood boost. It’s just a nice thing to do.

### 3. The Semi-altruistic Reason

If you’re at a large company, most feedback is going to come in waves at the one or maybe two performance cycles that happen on a yearly basis. If you’re only giving feedback then, it’s unlikely that anything you say is going to stand out, unless it’s deeply positive or negative. But if you share a constant drip of feedback, with a variety of people, positive feedback is a great way, especially for peer-feedback for you to influence the people around you. They’ll know what things they do that you appreciate and will be more likely to do them more often.

### In Conclusion

It takes about 5 minutes to do, just open up your email or Lattice or 15Five or ADP or whatever you use, find someone who you interacted with this week, and write them something. You’ll feel good and they’ll appreciate it. It’ll make your place of work a little bit better, make people feel a little bit more seen, and make you feel good about your coworkers.
