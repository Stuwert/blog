### What I’m Trying With All of This

I still remember when I first realized I was burnt out, trying to figure out what to do. It was a ton of focus on “rest and recovery”, advice which would be generally helpful to someone who was tired, but not really helpful for what I was experiencing.

The biggest piece of advice that connected with me was the concept that “burn out” wasn’t about working too much or too hard, it was about feeling out of control of your life.

But… beyond that there was basically nothing in the way of actually recovering from it. A lot of the sources wanted to focus on the challenge like a trauma. And, I suppose in the sense that it was something that was truly negative it was “trauma”, but it didn’t raise to the level of disrupting my ability to lead my life. It disrupted my ability to energetically push my life forward, and understanding how to grow past that was tough.

To give a bit of a tl;dr here, the metaphor I found most helpful was treating burn out like an emotional sprain or strain. Like twisting an ankle or pulling a hamstring. Doing “normal stuff” wasn’t hard, but I had to learn how to grow back through it.

### What is Burnout

I’ve casually talked a lot about burnout with friends before. There have been plenty of weeks where I spent too much time at work, didn’t get enough sleep, and needed to take a break in order to recover. This is how I described burnout before. And it’s what I thought about when I talked about it.

But then the pandemic hit, life got turned completely upside down, and the company I was working for had to go through layoffs and pay reductions to stay afloat.

That was emotionally challenging, but the other side of that was actually quite fun, freeing even. We didn’t have many users but we had tons of time and space to pick a direction and focus on it. It was great.

We got another round of funding and that was great.

And then we got bought, and everything changed.

### Joining Coupa

Coupa wasn’t a great fit for me. I became an engineering manager, the role I had been striving for what felt like my entire career and everything kind of changed.

I had read all of those things that said that shifting to engineering manager was a huge transition. And it was a compounding transition that I just wasn’t entirely ready for. I rebelled against basically all of it, but couldn’t figure out what was my emotions and what was genuine frustration.

So I started looking elsewhere, guessing that I just needed to change jobs, to change roles and it would get better, because Coupa was the issue.

Mid-2021 I left Coupa as a result and joined Guild.

### Joining Guild

After I quit Coupa and joined Guild I thought it would get better. The company was more closely aligned with my values, it fit the vision of where I thought Pana would have gone. And that felt great.

The company has a focus on employee experience, a great mission, and a bunch of problems to solve that felt like it should have lit me up. But it didn’t make me feel better. Actually it made me feel worse.

This was no fault of Guild’s. It just represented a clear picture of the future I had lost, a future where I would have to work to rebuild what I had lost. The inside jokes, the responsibility, the everything of it that I saw people sharing that could have been mine and no longer was.

And that hurt a lot.

And that’s when I realized I was completely and totally burnt out.

### The Narrative of It All

The outcome for me, was honestly about as well as I could’ve hoped. There was a small payout, I got a raise, ostensibly, and was employed by a larger company that had more and better stability. But part of me really was shattered. I was able to recognize the intelligence of the decision. We were a small travel company in a world where travel had been completely turned upside down. Our prospects were bleak and an exit (any exit) was valuable, much less one that resulted in a positive outcome for a large portion of the employees (and the investors).

But the narrative I had built about Pana shattered a bit. That vision of the company that was growing, and that my career would grow with.

I felt like I had finally hit it with Pana. I had found the right company and the right people where I could make an impact and grow with the company as it grew.

And just like that… it was gone.

### What It Felt Like

The hardest thing about burning out is that unlike other stress responses (I’ve had a decent amount of experience with anxiety and panic attacks), it wasn’t overwhelming. It didn’t dominate my life. It was a slow thrum, a slow drag that stopped me in my tracks whenever I wanted to pick up a new project, or go above and beyond at work.

It just felt like… why bother. Why bother going back through all of this effort trying to regrow my career only to see it fall apart again. Not just that I might not fit correctly, that some force outside of my control might completely eliminate that progress altogether.

It’s hard to say this stuff without seeing the privilege in all of it. Privileged white-boy suffers a minor setback and decides he can’t tell if it’s all worth it anymore.

And… there’s definitely some of that, but I’d dealt with having my vision changed before. This felt really different. This felt like… not just that I had lost something, but I had lost my people. Lost the community of people that I wanted to learn and grow with. And that loss hit harder than any personal gain.

### What Next

So I knew something was wrong. And for me, often that’s the step to just fixing it. But this went further.

So I started doing some research and trying to get a better perspective on where to go next.

Come back for Part 2 next week!
