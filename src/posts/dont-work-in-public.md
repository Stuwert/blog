There’s a lot of information floating around about the benefits to “work in public”, to keep a public record of the code you write and your thoughts so you can share it with the world. I felt a lot of pressure out of bootcamp to blog and work in public so that I could “get a job”.

Is all of this a potential way to get a job? Maybe. Is it necessary to work in public?

My short answer is no.

The longer answer is below:

I’m going to review the following:

1. What is working in public?
2. Why is it such a big deal in tech?
3. What are the downsides?
4. What are some other options?
5. When should you work in public?

## What is Working in Public?

Working in public is the idea that you should put on display all of the stuff that you’re doing, learning, and thinking about. This typically comes in the form of a blog where you provide links to things like projects, GitHub, and examples of the stuff that you’re doing. It can also come in the form of giving presentations at conferences, or contributing to an open source repository. This blog, and my [serverless series](https://www.urback.net/serverless/) are a great example of “working in public”. I’m trying to share what I learn, as I learn it, so other people can take advantage of the growth I experience.

## Why is it such a big deal?

Swyx’s [free chapter goes into solid depth on the primary arguments for working in public](https://learninpublic.org/v1-tactics-marketing-yourself.pdf).

I think there’s also something of a tech aesthetic going on here around being part of open source, and displaying your status by showing your dirty laundry. While I actually think it’s not a bad thing to have sharing be a status symbol, I also think it can go overboard occasionally.

But, the primary benefits for you and your career, are roughly:

- Improving Your Coding Skills
- Having an easier time getting jobs
- Having a higher net worth overall

### Improving Your Coding Skills

Having to explain yourself to other people [is proven](https://www.livescience.com/34000-explaining-helps-understand.html) to be a good way to sharpen your understanding and clarify places where you lack knowledge. (There’s this thing human brains do where we will assume we know something if we know someone who knows about that thing. For example, if you ask most people if they know how a toilet works, they will say yes. If you ask most people how to describe the functioning of a toilet, they will struggle).

Working in public also gives you the ability to receive feedback about what you do and don’t know. You might get new ideas from people you share the work with, or you might have someone share something you were wrong about.

### Having an Easier Time Getting Jobs

Having publicly available material you can point at in job interviews can be a huge benefit. It can mean sharing your website for your prospective-employer to get to know you better. And, if you have some level of notoriety maybe they’ve already read your work and have a pretty good sense of who you are.

It’s also a good way of verifying your skill. You don’t have to go through thirteen rounds of a front end interview to prove your coding chops if you’ve built some clever UI elements in a personal website, or made a significant contribution to an open source repository.

### Having a Higher Net Worth Overall

Swyx calls this expanding your luck surface area. Putting yourself out there theoretically opens you up to opportunities you might not even be thinking about.

## Downsides to working in public

I’m skeptical that there’s a specific, obvious reward for junior engineers to having a website where their work is visible. I can remember each time I’ve gone into a new job search thinking “it would be great if I had a blog” and then it basically never coming up again the second I actually had a job.

So what are the downsides to working in public?

- It takes a ton of time and effort
- Building a small following and portfolio is a long term investment
- It’s probably not the primary way you’re going to find your next job

### It takes a ton of time and effort

Part of being in a [40 year career](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/) means doing things that increase your longevity, not necessarily things that maximize output and keep you in the game. Working in public in an effort to get a job might not serve you all that well.

Saying “work in public” sounds great, evoking this concept of just taking all the shit you already do and putting it on a website. But that’s probably not going to get the exposure you want (or need?). And I’m not even talking about the potentially immense emotional effort and risk involved. I just mean, when you learn something as the result of a failure, it actually takes a lot of effort and refinement to structure that in a way that’s legible for other people.

It’s often not enough to just have a repository, or a deployed site, you likely want a solid README, or a post-mortem, or a demo or some documentation explaining what’s going on. And simply writing a list of “what you want to eventually do” probably isn’t gong to be as helpful as you think it is. What you really want is to tell your viewer a story, helping them boot up the project, or be able to explain to them what you did.

For example, even something like my “serverless” project, can seem excessively straightforward, trying to figure out the beginning and end of each article is... an incredible challenge, actually. I’ve put a lot of thought into what order articles should go in, and whether or not some even belong, long before I actually click the publish button.

### Build even a small following is a long term investment

Writing can definitely pay off, but in terms of increasing your luck surface area it’s probably going to be 1 or more years before you see the sort of cumulative impact from a blog that you might expect. I’m imagining outcomes like getting a job opportunity, getting a promotion or a raise, or making a connection with someone that might not have known you otherwise.

### It’s probably not the primary way you’re going to find your next job

And… if there is, you’re probably not going to see it for multiple years of your career. I.e. It’s the type of thing that will pay off for you 5-8 years down the line. This can be hugely beneficial for you, but when you’re just starting out trying to get a job, it might not be the most practical advice.

## Other Options: Private and Semi-Private Work

This is actually something Swyx goes into great detail in Section 1.8 of [marketing yourself](https://learninpublic.org/v1-tactics-marketing-yourself.pdf) to your fellow humans. And, while I don’t necessarily agree with the framing, I do think the underlying logic is solid. It’s worth it to spend some effort making your work visible to the people around you. They probably know less about what you’re doing than you might think.

As an alternate to “working in public”, I’m going to focus on a couple of things:

1. Practice writing. Journal.
2. Keep a brag book.
3. Maintain a list of connections you want to maintain

## Journal

Yeah, I said it. Im old fashioned. But other people don’t need to read your writing for it to be useful. You get a lot just by putting your thoughts out there. If keeping a blog **helps** your journal, great, do that. But the main goal is to write and articulate your thoughts on paper, and see where you do and don’t have gaps. It’s like 80% of the benefit of writing in public but without having to worry about things like grammar, spell check or legibility. And if some day in the future you want to turn it into a piece of writing, it’s a great starting point.

## Capturing Your Output

Along with journaling [you should keep a running track of stuff you’ve accomplished](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents). Some work you can copy screenshots, some work you might want to write a quick paragraph.

First of all, it’ll make you feel good about yourself. Yes your friends might not understand that creating a login page is a huge undertaking, but your brag book does. Your brag book will never let you down.

Secondly, it gets you in the habit of practicing talking about stuff you’ve done. So you’re ready to go when it comes up.

Finally, you don’t have to use every element in the doc for a job or promotion. Having a list means you can select from a buffet of options that best meet the moment.

The thing you should do, is capture and be able to speak favorably about things you have done.

For some people this means blogging, but the real goal here is being up to date on the stuff you talk about.

Brag documents are 110% the most important thing you can do to boost your career regardless of what stage you are in.

What I mean by that isn’t that your screwed either way... just that. The sorts of times where talking about your failures and successes becomes most important happens in a couple of key moments

- hiring
- Promotions

And so having a collected body of examples for those moments is absolutely key. I highly recommend collecting and cultivating a “brag book” or a list of accomplishments you can pick from.

## Cultivating Your Private Network

Once you get in a job, one of the best things you can do is to cultivate an internal network of people who you would like to stay in touch with over time. This means cultivating those relationships above and beyond what you might do just interacting with them at work. Invite them to coffee, and set up recurring times to stay in touch (especially if they end up leaving!). These are the people who will vouch for you, refer you, and help you find your next opportunity. (And you for them)

Your two most important networks are the people you go to school with (middle school, high school, college, post college, continuing Ed) and the people you work with (employment, volunteering). These are the people who will want to help you in plenty of small and private ways. Through keeping eyes open for you or outright recommending you for positions.

Even in “public” discourse, what really happens are cross sections of highly connected networks of people respond to each other. And those connections are on display publicly, but a lot of the value and leverage is private.

The problem is these connections may take a long time to pay off, and you might never explicitly see a direct benefit. But the pieces of information and communication really are core to your ability to succeed on the job market.

A lot of my success has come (along with the privilege) from having a group of people who believe in me. It’s helped open up potential job opportunities, or given me perspective on what decisions I might make in the future. It’s very private work (and honestly people are fun to be around, so stay in touch with the ones you like!) but it’s a huge leverage point in your career.

The Yale course [The Science of Well](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) being talks about how people overrate how much other people will be annoyed by their intrusions and underrate how much satisfaction they’ll get out of them. So reach out.

## When To Work In Public

The goal of my writing here isn’t to convince you not to write or try to commit to an open source project. Rather, I’m trying to destress the situation where you feel like you **have to do these things** to have a sustainable career. If you want to write, if you want to contribute to open source, you should absolutely do it! Just do it for intrinsic reasons and not because you feel like you have to as some sort of stress response to the scariness of the tech world.

### The Exception

There is one **incredibly compelling reason** to work in public, and that’s in the case where you want to do the type of writing or public stuff that helps bring something to life that wouldn’t exist without your input. This doesn’t have to be huge, but it’s a really compelling reason to work in public and if you find one of those areas, there’s a chance you’ve hit on something really fun and exciting. (But don’t feel like you have to!)

I’m thinking of blogs like:

- [https://jvns.ca/](https://jvns.ca/) work on answering questions about how coding and computers work
- [https://lethain.com/](https://lethain.com/) work on tech leadership
- [https://charity.wtf/](https://charity.wtf/) work on tech careers

The point here isn’t their fame, it’s that they’ve found areas of interest where they felt they could make a meaningful contribution, and so there was benefit to working in public. If you can find one of those (even if it’s just for your 5 friends), you’ll likely feel the type of dedication and commitment to keeping it up as a practice.

If not, that’s ok too! You can write and work on your side projects off and on as you have the energy and time.

## There Is No One Way to Shape a Career

Starting out is the toughest part of your career, especially in software engineering where the tools change constantly and it can feel like you’re swimming into a wide and deep ocean. There’s no one way to do it. Just keep swimming.
