## Being Visible to the People You Lead

In my last post I talked about Staff Engineering being a bullshit role, and I should probably expand upon that here, for a variety of reasons.

There’s a lot of discussion about how as an individual contributor it’s important to “make your work visible” to higher ups in order to get the appropriate resources, opportunities for advancement, etc. But there is relatively little discussion going the other direction about being a leader and making your work visible to the people whom you lead.

I basically think that’s a mistake.

The reason I call leadership a “bullshit” job is that it’s primarily one of communication, and therefor the line between doing self-serving bullshit and doing your job is actually incredibly thin.

I was talking through this with my manager and gave an example about a failed or delayed project. Let’s say I, as a staff engineer, am working on a team with a project that’s likely to miss its deadline. I have a few options. I can:

1. Communicate resolution steps to the team but not take part in resolving the failures
2. Note that there’s an issue, but stay out of resolution determination with the team
3. Communicate with the team and take an active role in making the project a success

In various points each of these outcomes could be **the exactly right thing to do for the team**, it’s also possible that #1 could be a complete copout that sells the team short for my own failing. It’s also possible that #3 could mean I end up overshadowing the team. Maybe we feel great that we launched, but there’s resentment that now people outside of the team see the project as mine instead of the team’s or the other project leads.

What’s “bullshit” about this is that unlike other roles where there’s more direct guidance on the sorts of actions I should take, in the Staff+, and other leadership, roles that determination is solely up to me, depending on how I feel about the situation and what I think would be best. And as always, the easiest person to fool is yourself. So it would be so easy to make the wrong decision, explain away the outcome, and then pat myself on the back for a job well done.

What’s probably more accurately described as weird, instead of bullshit, is that this requires a constant sort of vigilance in terms of reflection and understanding of my own behavior. Even **asking for feedback from the people impacted** won’t necessarily be a good barometer. People could be happy I jumped in and fail to see the negative externality I just caused on their career, or people could be unhappy I didn’t jump in, but fail to see the way the career growth and positive feedback they got for their response to the challenge improved their careers.

**Note: This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t ask for feedback. It’s to say that the feedback is non-determinative in a way that it’s not in other roles.**

### Being Visible to the People You Lead

But where this really gets me to is the extent that being visible to the people you lead is so important and the cost of being invisible is problematic.

When we talk about upward visibility the career benefits are obvious, better opportunities for advancement and more interesting problems to solve. The value of downward visibility isn’t clear, and it’s often not talked about the costs to not being downwardly visible. If the people who you lead don’t know what you’re doing for them, there is no career cost to you. There might be an efficiency cost to the team, but it’s unlikely to immediately have an impact one way or another.

I think a lot about the conversations where my friends have said something along the lines of “What is X director even doing”. (If you’re my director and happen to be reading this I promise I’m not talking about you, you’re great.) When one of the primary values you provide is your ability to communicate, making yourself visible to the people beneath you is equally important.

The unspoken cost isn’t the fact that they won’t do what you want, it’s how willing they’ll be to follow along with what you say when there’s a huge gap between your vision and the current state of reality, and how hard they’ll fight and take ownership of that vision as their own.

### Being Visible is Easy as an IC

I’ve even found myself falling into the trap saying stuff like “oh haha I don’t really do anything” when I’m writing documents or not coding. And I’ve also heard phrases like “I catch the bullshit” from many a manager. But those sorts of flippant statements ignore the reality of the world where you are likely compensated more, and do little to make it clear what sorts of problems you are wrangling in your role.

As an IC slash leader it’s easy to default back to doing visible work so you feel valued, and so that you can “show value” to the rest of your team. You can always pick up tickets! [https://lethain.com/reminiscing/] But as Will Larson makes clear, that’s much more akin to snacking than providing actual value, or doing the hard work of explaining to your team (and encouraging them to challenge you) on the 3+ month vision doc you’re building out, or making visible the sorts of conversations you’re having to the rest of the org. It’s certainly possible that working that ticket is the most important thing you could be working on, but even so, I think you should have an answer beyond “I’m a developer and I’m shipping code”.
