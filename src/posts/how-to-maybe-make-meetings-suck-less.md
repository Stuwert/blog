- Be explicit about what participation looks like
- Visualize your goals + narrow them
- (Gently) interrupt people and redirect them if they're rambling
- Keep an eye out on participation
- Avoid cursed conversations
- Use Status to Your Advantage
- Meetings should have a point and "Culture Building" wears out its welcome pretty quickly

Somewhat surprisingly to me, I've collected a bit of a reputation and an ability to run a solid meetings. I get a lot of positive feedback about how meetings I run being energizing and containing great outcomes.

I think meeting leadership is a skill (one that I'm continually trying to develop) and I want to try to share and articulate what I've learned here:

## Firstly, a Huge Caveat

**A well-reviewed or poorly-reviewed meeting has a loose relationship towards whether or not it was effective.**

Let me restate that really quick:

How well your meeting is **reviewed** has a **loose correlation** with how successful it might be.

The goal of this article is to share some tips and tricks to help you run a more successful and more fun meeting, but no amount of positive feedback actually means you're meeting was a success. There are a couple of reasons for this:

1. Humans are really bad at judging whether or not they successfully learned content

Studies show that people will consistently rate professors more highly when they lecture. People will also say that they learned more. Studies show that lectures are one of the least effective ways for people to learn new facts. The reality is, we just **really** suck at knowing what makes us effective learners. Our brains are kinda silly mush buckets. For example, doing something as simple as fuzzing the text on a document will make you more likely to learn content because it was harder to retrieve and therefor your personal mushbucket assumed that meant it was more important.

Does this mean we should go ahead and make all meetings miserable? F\*\*\* no. But if you really care about how effective a meeting is (especially a recurring one), you need to do the product thing you do with everything else and assign metrics to it and use dispassionate analysis to make that decision, and not ask your engineers if they’d be rather coding than talking to other people.

2. As much as humans (especially engineers) hate meetings, they do really like being around other people

So the meeting success rate (from a positive/negative review) will have more to do if people feel like they enjoyed being around the other people, and if the people they care about said useful things or if they got to say useful things to those people. Neither of these are really markers of the success of your meeting.

3. Meeting feedback has more to do with how it worked within the rest of a person's week than it has to do with the meeting itself

What I mean by this is a poorly run meeting on a Friday when people are already checked out is going to get reviewed way more highly than a really well run meeting in the middle of a Wednesday when people are stressed about their week.

### End Caveat

All that being said, you should absolutely try really hard run good meetings. They will make the teams you are on more effective, you will enjoy the people you work with more, and you will probably look good doing it!

# The Overview

Here's the list of things we're going to walk through today

- Be explicit about what participation looks like
- Meetings should have a point (and culture meetings work so many times)
- Your subject matter should be specific
- Keep control of your meeting
- Use status on a team and within an organization effectively
- Restate takeaways liberally

You'll notice a lot of these mean that you as the meeting facilitator will need to take a lot of proactive action to keep your meeting in line, potentially putting you in (gentle but) direct disagreement with the people around you. This might make you uncomfortable (it definitely makes me uncomfortable occasionally), but it's important to remember with all of this, these rules aren't there to make you look good, they're there to ensure the success of the meeting for all its participants.

## 1. Be explicit about what participation looks like

This is one of the ones that I think gets missed the most. When you start a meeting you should have a pretty good idea of how you want people to behave. What types of things you want them to contribute and how you expect to respond.

You might be concerned that this will create meetings that are dry, boring, and prevent you from making new and interesting conclusions. The opposite is true, Having a concept of what positive behavior looks like ahead of time will give you a clearer signal for

For a document review meeting this might mean you expect participation to come in the form of feedback on the document. This means that feedback that takes you away from this is giving you signal that people might not understand context, there's gaps in the document you need to fill, or maybe there's an exciting new direction you can pursue. But having this in your head at the start will give you a fighting chance to make those decisions when they come up. If you don't know what success looks like when you start, it's going to be really hard to make adjustments as you go.

### What Meeting Design is Not: A Checklist

One of the weirdest parts to me is this concept that Company Culture is this sacred and unique orb that must be protected at all costs but meeting decisions can be farmed out to whatever someone who interned for Jeff Bezos once has to say about how to write a memo. Ostensibly meetings are in fact one of the primary ways that your company culture is perpetuated. Maybe… you should care about them a bit?

With meetings, like culture, there are definitely best practices, things to note, and things to stay away from, but like good software engineering and good product management. There’s a lot of nuance and skill into running them well. You should spend a lot of time and care thinking about the meetings that you’re running and what you want to get out of them. Think about your Objectives, how you will measure success, and what you’d like each person to experience at them. I get that it’s a lot to think about, but you should care if you’re leading a meeting. That’s presumably what you’re here to do?

When we think about participation, we can also explicitly make sure that participation fits with the cultural values of the company we're a part of. In fact, I would argue meeting design is one of the most important expressions of your company culture. If you want your culture to be loose and friendly, you should be able to envision people cracking the occasional joke without getting off topic. If you expect your company culture to be formal, efficient, and always on topic, you can be prepared for that too.

## 2. Meetings should have a point

For most people meetings feel the most effective when the narrative of the meeting feels like they transported you from point A to point B, preferably closer to your goals.

This can look like one of the following:
a. You learned something that you will be able to directly apply to your job/life that will make you happier or more effective
b. You learned something that you care about and that adds to a body of knowledge of your personal interests
c. You felt like you were able to contribute in a way that meaningfully changed the direction of your group’s decision, thereby making you feel important
d. You got to spend time getting to know the people you care about and thereby enriching your life.

A lot of people will tell you it's important that you set all of this out in a document in advance. And generally you should absolutely do this if you can, but with adhoc meetings, quick chats, or meetings where you know what you need but don't know how to articulate it, it's important even if you can't explicitly write it out that you have a clear vision for what you're aiming for. This will help guide you through the time you spend. Like a narrative you want to be sure that every action in the meeting is in some small way driving towards the conclusion you're looking for.

### Danger Zones: Company Culture Meetings and Presentations

The "this could have been an email" response seems like a helpful note that "maybe this meeting wasn't useful", but it actually signals something way deeper: "this information is likely irrelevant to me and I could successfully ignore it without it impacting my job". This especially applies to culture and rituals not because they aren't important but because they need to serve a dual purpose of being valuable and enjoyable.

This can be hard especially in remote cultures where you want to both make sure everyone is on the same page and also interacting with one another. But I've learned the hard way that having meetings on the calendar just to keep people "informed" or "in touch" isn't that effective unless they're getting direct enjoyment from them.

Presentations also fall in this bucket. Maybe you think you're rolling out some new technology that other engineers need to know about, or maybe you think that it's important that various departments know what everyone else is up to. But giving some contextless mush about generic things that are happening (even if you make them fun) is going to make people tune out. Even with demos, brags, and exciting news, you should spend a bunch of time trying to figure out what your participants care about and why. This only gets harder as the audience size of a presentation or meeting grows, but you need to keep it specific and ideally actionable.

If you're thinking to yourself (crap this means I have a lot of work to do), yes it absolutely does. The larger the audience means the more time you're taking up, means the more time investment you should put in up front to make sure that time is well spent.

## 3. Your Subject Matter Should be Specific

I think we all have this belief (and fear) that in order to reach the widest audience possible, we need to make our discussions and presentations as abstract as possible. [First Focus, Then Simplify](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-2852-first-focus-then-simplify) has a great discussion on why this is such a bad idea.

For one, if you're incredibly abstract, you're going to get a bunch of abstract aphorisms back. You might be worried that if you're too specific your meeting participants won't understand you, but you should take that as a signal that your goals for the meeting and your participants might not be aligned.

I would advocate for two steps towards meeting and topic participation:

1. Broadly frame the problem you are trying to solve or the thing you are trying to do.
2. Quickly move towards specific examples of what you need help, support, or want to explain to your participants

You should feel comfortable trusting that your participants will be able to work through the steps required to understand what you need for them, or to ask questions to get there. There's some amount of "feel" to this, but I would tend to air on the side of giving people less information and letting them ask it rather than overloading them. I promise it won't make you look stupid and will actually get participants engaged in the process.

## 4. Keep control of your meeting

So you've visualized what your successful meeting or presentation looks like, you've prepared and now you're in the thick of it. What next?

People tend to get nervous here because we don't want to feel pushy, overbearing, or like we're egomaniacal and want to only keep the meeting for our purposes, but it's really important that you keep your meeting moving towards the end goal you had in mind.

This means if people start to drift off topic, you can and should feel comfortable interrupting them and _asking_ if this can be tabled or moved to a separate discussion. You're not just doing this for you, you're doing it for the participants who would like to be engaged but don't have the power and status to feel like they can speak up. This sort of facilitation is also important to maintain equity within the conversation. Keeping control of your meeting means you can pause at multiple points to ask others if they would like to ask questions or share their own insights.

It's important to remember here that you probably have enough time for 1-2 substantial decisions per 30 minute time block. This means if you have an hour and you want to get through 3-4 decisions, you really do need to be conscious of time and keep conversations moving forward.

### What to Avoid: Cursed Conversations

Some people call it swirl, others call it circling, I call them cursed conversations. These are moments in meetings that are high emotion and low outcome. Ironically, discussions about meeting structures tend to create these sorts of cursed conversations.

My opinion is that cursed conversations are their own form of [bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). They tend to be high emotion but low importance, so people feel empowered to share their opinion freely but without taking responsibility for the outcome. My recommendation here is to engage a manager, director, or other high status individual to either make the decision for the group, or to assign an owner and move on. Trying to engage these sorts of conversations (or nudge them off) tend to backfire as people will feel strongly enough that it's wroth continuing to push on the topic.

## 4. Use status to set good examples

One mistake I see get made a lot is by people who kick of meetings and who want broad involvement. So they throw out lots of fun words about how everybody is invited and it’s open season for anyone to contribute. And then shocker you get a lot of blank faces and not much involvement.

We really don’t talk about status in tech a lot (or enough), but the first few iterations of a new meeting is one of the absolute best and most important you should engage people of high status (or use your own) to set the standard for how things are going to go.

High status individuals should set the floor for lowest common denominator you expect and would like to see from your participants. That means if you want a junior engineer to feel comfortable asking a question that might make them look foolish, they should see a senior or staff engineer doing it first. High status individuals will set the boundaries for the sorts of behaviors that are acceptable and other participants will "draft" off of their example by mimicking it and doing that behavior themselves.

### Strongly Held Belief: High Status Individuals Should Try to "De-Status" themselves more

I don't think we talk enough about the fact that once you're in an "important" role there's a lot of pressure on you to continue to appear "important". This can take the form of behavior that will have high status individuals only answering and contributing to things that are comfortably within their domain, withholding about questions they're less knowledgeable about, and being careful about appearing foolish or silly.

I think leaders should take more time to carefully and thoughtfully display the sorts of risk taking behavior they would like people to see. [Being Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/Being-Wrong-Adventures-Margin-Error/dp/0061176052) differentiates two types of confidence: social and knowledge based confidence. Often humans tend conflate the two but they are very separate. Someone can show low knowledge confidence while retaining high social status by continuing to send queues about their levels of comfort and relaxedness, while asking questions that might make them look like a novice, or admitting where they have gaps in their understanding. Especially in meetings and group settings, leaders should do this more.

## 5. Restate takeaways liberally

I think people occasionally have a fear of repeating themselves because we tend to associate repetition with age and the mistakes that come with losing our faculties to time. But... the reality is, participants will not understand what they're learning the first time, or the second time, or the third time. This means when key points and action items pop up you should repeat them. Repeat them so everyone knows what's happening and then repeat them at the end so we all know what we learned.

This follows along with "keep control", because it's part of that, but you should absolutely feel empowered to throw on the breaks of meeting where you aren't 100% certain everyone is on the same page. And this is true if **even if you aren't leading the meeting**.

Lemme repeat that: if you have **sincere concerns that people aren't all on the same pages** you should feel empowered to **slam the breaks**. Don't be an asshole about this, but jumping in to say "Hey, that felt really important and I'm not sure we're on the same page, here's what I heard [restate what you heard]", is a really powerful way to make sure your meetings have value.

## Bonus: Trust Your Participants... Seriously... Trust Them... It Will Be Ok

One of the things I hate the most about modern meeting design that flows around LinkedIn like some sort of bad fart is that the best way to design meetings is to treat your participants like a bunch of idiots who have to be gently lead around so they can figure out what’s going on.

You work with a bunch of smart and thoughtful people.

Lemme repeat that again

You work with a bunch of smart and thoughtful people.

A lot of modern meeting design is focused on pushing information to people who are aggressively disinterested in what you have to say, as though the main goal of getting together with other people is that they should have memory retrieval of a specific bullet point or phrase that you said.

That’s frankly stupid. What you need to do is put in the thought and effort to make sure that people you invite to your meetings can be successful **participants** in a way that helps you and them execute on the problem or project you're trying to make progress on. It's a genuinely hard problem to solve, but it doesn't require tricks, or feints of hand, or sleights.

The best way to do that is to make sure that what you’re saying has a direct and concrete impact on their jobs, lives, or interests. Once you have that you can have all sorts of really fun discussions
