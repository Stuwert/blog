Weirdly enough, I’ve collected the ability to run a solid meeting. I tend to get a lot of snappy feedback about the productivity and how people feel good about the meetings. It’s led me to some concepts about what makes people feel constitutes a good meeting

1. A well-reviewed or poorly-reviewed meeting has a loose relationship towards whether or not it was effective.

We really need to rip this bandaid off incredibly quickly. My experience has been that there’s just not much relationship between how well a meeting was run and how important it is to a group’s effectiveness. This isn’t to say that you can’t or shouldn’t try to cull meetings that have lost their effectiveness. Just that… well, a developer telling you they thought a meeting was stupid or good is about an equally emotional decision. The whole “could this have been an email” is a really great sentiment but is more about how meetings make us feel than how effective they are.

Studies show that people will consistently rate professors more highly when they lecture. People will also say that they learned more. Studies show that lectures are one of the least effective ways for people to learn new facts. The reality is, we just **really** suck at knowing what makes us effective learners. Our brains are kinda silly mush buckets. For example, doing something as simple as fuzzing the text on a document will make you more likely to learn content because it was harder to retrieve and therefor your personal mushbucket assumed that meant it was more important.

Does this mean we should go ahead and make all meetings miserable? F\*\*\* no. But if you really care about how effective a meeting is (especially a recurring one), you need to do the product thing you do with everything else and assign metrics to it and use dispassionate analysis to make that decision, and not ask your engineers if they’d be rather coding than talking to other people.

1. Meetings feel the most effective when the narrative of the meeting feels like they transported you from point A to point B, preferably closer to your goals.

This is the danger zone. The zone where you can make incredibly effective meetings or ones that feel incredibly effective but got you absolutely nowhere. In my experience feeling like you were transported from A→B during some sort of group conversation typically comes down to a few things:

1. You learned something that you will be able to directly apply to your job/life that will make you happier or more effective
2. You learned something that you care about and that adds to a body of knowledge of your personal interests
3. You felt like you were able to contribute in a way that meaningfully changed the direction of your group’s decision, thereby making you feel important
4. You got to spend time getting to know the people you care about and thereby enriching your life.

I want to include number 4 specifically because I think developers basically underrate the importance of that one both in why zombie meetings tend to stay around when they feel useless.

A (and sometimes C) is honestly the only metric that “really matters” to a business, but there are plenty of ways to make people feel good about a meeting. But again, we really suck about what makes us feel like we learned something. So be careful.

1. You should basically try to avoid all meetings where you’re pushing information at people. Actually scratch that, you should basically try to avoid pushing information people at all, basically ever

If you’re pushing context at people you’ve basically already lost the battle. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been in a situation where I’ve tried to describe something to a group of semi-interested people (who were ostensibly predisposed to be interested in what I was talking about!!) only to watch their eyes glaze over and their minds slowly disconnect from their bodies and think about what they’re eating for lunch/dinner/etc.

If you do need to push information at people, there’s a few tricks you can engage to make them uptake. But it really comes down to a+c from above. Either ask them specific questions that they will have opinions about, or tell them there is very specific action they need to take as a result of this discussion.

And the whole “don’t push information”. Look you might be making drastic changes to your employee’s health policy and you need to give them a month’s time to make sure they know what you’re talking about but that “could this have been an email” quickly becomes “oh I archived it because it didn’t impact my day to day job”.

So how do we engage in a or c for the most success?

### For Pushing Information

1. Explain how this will directly impact their lives in the next 1 hour to 1 day
2. Tell a story about where you’re going and the impacts it will have eventually
3. Talk about the specific implementation details you’ll have to get there
4. Focus on specifics, don’t try to describe an elephant

The goal isn’t to be manipulative here. If you have to do a lot of work to get it to fit into those criteria, you should really ask if you’ve prepped enough to have this conversation or whether or not this is important enough in the first place.

But the reality is if you focus only on two and three, people aren’t going to pay much attention even if it has a direct and immediate impact. You should start with a specific example of the impact, and then dive into the thing they care about talking about. You will get engaged discussion on two and three.

And finally, do not abstract it. There’s that stupid aphorism that business people love to throw around where you have a bunch of idiots standing around an Elephant and they’re describing it as one sort of specific object but in reality they just needed to see the whole picture and then they could’ve understood! By god that’s great!

It’s not.

This is not an invitation to hide things from people, or even to talk about a level of abstraction and nothing else. What it is an invitation to do is to

1. start with a specific thing
2. describe the rest of that thing in as many general details as you can get away with

In this (beaten to death) example, we might be talking about the elephant’s trunk. Rather than zooming out and trying to describe this entire thing. You might start by giving the detail of the trunk, how it can be use as an appendage, how long it is, how it’s used to drink water and communicate. And then go on to describe the rest of an Elephant in fairly rough terms. It’s huge, has four legs and a tail, is very smart.

The reason for focusing like this is humans are INCREDIBLY good at starting with one link in a chain and using that to jump to the next link and the next and the next until they’ve sussed out the entire context of the thing. You don’t need to give them all of it in high definition. Give your audience enough to whet their appetite and the broader context so they stay in the realm you want them.

Another aphorism that sometimes gets ping ponged about in business circles is the “0 to 50,000 feet”. For the level of focus and abstraction. At 0 feet you are fully in the detail, and as you go up in the atmosphere you get less detail but more of an overall picture. My opinion (especially when it comes to meetings) is that the most dangerous territory is between 10 and 40 thousand feet. It’s where you have some level of abstraction so you don’t know specifically what’s happening, but not enough context to provide any useful detail. You want to give a super high level and then super zoomed in.

1. This one is less substantiated but… Your First Three Meetings of Any New Process probably are the biggest and will define how that meeting will go

One mistake I see get made a lot is by people who kick of meetings and who want broad involvement. So they throw out lots of fun words about how everybody is invited and it’s open season for anyone to contribute. And then shocker you get a lot of blank faces and not much involvement.

We really don’t talk about status in tech a lot (or enough), but the first few iterations of a new meeting is one of the absolute best and most important you should engage people of high status (or use your own) to set the standard for how things are going to go.

You should carefully think about the first few iterations and run as tight a session as possible. This can occasionally mean cutting people off earlier than you might, and engaging high status stakeholders to display the behaviors you would like to see across groups. For example, if throwing out wacky ideas is something you want, you should find a director or someone to throw out an idea that might get them ridiculed. It will send a very clear message that everything is welcome, way faster than your prompts. You should also think very clearly about rules for participation.

Even if you want a free flowing discussion, strict rules (time limits, prompts, expectations) will tend to get people more involved and create more discussion rather than less. Some rough guidelines I might recommend:

You probably have enough time to have 2 substantial decisions per 30 minute block. This means that if you want someone to come up with a substantial discussion you could assign them a 15 minute block of time and a single question/answer they would like (that they run by you). You can change these numbers as you need. If it’s more of a presentation, you should think hard about when you pause and why you pause. Are you asking if people need clarification, or is this the moment that they should jump in and give advice. Have this stuff at least thought through in your head and communicated to the people you’re working with ahead of time.

1. Meeting Design Isn’t… A Checklist

One of the weirdest parts to me is this concept that Company Culture is this sacred and unique orb that must be protected at all costs but meeting decisions can be farmed out to whatever someone who interned for Jeff Bezos once has to say about how to write a memo. Ostensibly meetings are in fact one of the primary ways that your company culture is perpetuated. Maybe… you should care about them a bit?

With meetings, like culture, there are definitely best practices, things to note, and things to stay away from, but like good software engineering and good product management. There’s a lot of nuance and skill into running them well. You should spend a lot of time and care thinking about the meetings that you’re running and what you want to get out of them. Think about your Objectives, how you will measure success, and what you’d like each person to experience at them. I get that it’s a lot to think about, but you should care if you’re leading a meeting. That’s presumably what you’re here to do?

1. Seriously trust your audience, just… trust them. They’re smart. I promise

One of the things I hate the most about modern meeting design that flows around LinkedIn like some sort of bad fart is that the best way to design meetings is to treat your audience like a bunch of idiots who have to be gently lead around so they can figure out what’s going on.

That’s frankly stupid. What you need to do is put in the thought and effort to make sure that what you’re telling them or asking them is salient. And the best way to do that is to make sure that what you’re saying has a direct and concrete impact on their jobs, lives, or interests. Once you have that you can have all sorts of really fun discussions
