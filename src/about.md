Hi I'm Stuart.

I've been in technology (as a software engineer or project manager) for about 10 years now.

This blog will contain a host of writing from things as specific as how to debug the `datasource` file when trying to implement Typeorm to things as broad as general tech tips and advice, or things outside of engineering like games and general media.
