Hi I'm Stuart.

I'm currently a Senior Engineer for [Guild Education](https://guildeducation.com), but I've been in technology (as a software engineer or project manager) for about 10 years now.

I have a lot of thoughts, mostly about tech and leadership, but I also love writing about games. This probably means there will be an eclectic mix of stuff that you find somewhat relevant and completely irrelevant.

My goal is to be sincere, contrarian, modestly sarcastic but not in that obnoxious way where I'm trying to sell you something.
